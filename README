== Overview ==

Sidebar Content is an extension to MediaWiki that allows you to define
additional content that goes into the sidebar, via pages in the MediaWiki:
namespace. To add a section, choose a "portlet" in the sidebar (an element
with class "mw-portlet") under which you want to place your content, get
its name (its ID will be "p-PortletName"), create page in the MediaWiki
namespace with the new content (e.g., "MediaWiki:NewContent"), and then
add the following to LocalSettings.php, below the inclusion of Sidebar
Content:

$wgSidebarContentMessages['PortletName'] = 'NewContent';
